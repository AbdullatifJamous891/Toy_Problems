// 1-define objects for 5 of your classmater containing the following keys:

	var friends={

			age:34,22,25,,24,27 
			favorieSports:"Flying Disk ","  ", " "

	}
	var 

// 2-depending on the previous exercises , write a function that returns the older classmate from mates array.

// 3-write a function that takes an object as argument and returns how many keys does that object contain.
	 nbOfObjKeys({}) // ==> 0
	 nbOfObjKeys({name:"housam",age:"3"}) // ==> 2

// if you finished the above, solve the following:
// write a function that takes array of strings and returns an array of the strings that have the same length
	    ['hi','hello','welcome','hy'] // ==> ["hi","hy"]
