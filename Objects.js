// 1-define objects for 5 of your classmater containing the following keys:
	// -full name 
	// -age 
	// -favorite sports 
	// -nationality
	// and then save theme in one array called mates!

var mates = [
{name:{firstName:"shefaa", secondName:"almostafaa"}, age:17, favoriteSports: "tennis", nationality: "Syria"},
{name:{firstName:"samer", secondName:"salmeh"}, age:25, favoriteSports: "wrustling", nationality: "Syria"},
{name:{firstName:"safwan", secondName:"almoukdad"}, age:27, favoriteSports: "football", nationality: "jordan"},
{name:{firstName:"khadija", secondName:"almostafaa"}, age:19, favoriteSports: "basketball", nationality: "Syria"},
{name:{firstName:"ahmad", secondName:"alzoubay"}, age:26, favoriteSports: "pingball", nationality: "Syria"}
	]
// 2-depending on the previous exercises , write a function that returns the older classmate from mates array.
function older(arr){
	for(var i=0;arr[i]<arr[arr.length];i++){
		var age=[];
		for(var key in arr){
        age.
		}

	}
}    
// 3-write a function that takes an object as argument and returns how many keys does that object contain.
	 nbOfObjKeys({}) // ==> 0
	 nbOfObjKeys({name:"housam",age:"3"}) // ==> 2

// if you finished the above, solve the following:
// write a function that takes array of strings and returns an array of the strings that have the same length
	    ['hi','hello','welcome','hy'] // ==> ["hi","hy"]
